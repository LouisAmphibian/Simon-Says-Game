The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it uses the DOM to dynamically update the displayed result.

- Make sure you have Visual Studio community(https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) installed


## Running the Software
1. Open your code editor and navigate to the folder containing the Dice Game files.
2. Open the index.html file in your code editor.
3. You can view the Dice Game by opening the index.html file directly in your web browser. To do this, right-click the file and select "Open with" followed by your preferred web browser.
4. Alternatively, if you have a live server extension (e.g., Live Server for VS Code), you can use it to run the project:
